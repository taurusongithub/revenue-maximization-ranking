"""The Best-x algorithm.

When facing the random attention span problem, the optimal ranking lets
call it "sigma" for a fixed attention span x (one from {1, 2, ..., M})
make up to a revenue of R("sigma", x) for a fraction G_x = Prob(X >= x)
of customers, where X is the distribution of attention spans.

Following this strategy each possible value of x gives a lower bound on
the expected revenue, so we choose the "best x"! That is the one for
which the lower bound is maximum, the corresponding optimal ranking for
that attention span will be used.

Since this "best" x can be much smaller than the capacity M we propose
the following adaptation:
  - Choose the "best" x and its corresponding ranking for the first x
  elements,
  - remove those first x products from the original set of products and
  solve for the "best next" x again considering capacity M - x.
  - repeat until capacity is 0.

Functions
---------
    best_x:
        It finds the x for the maximum lower bound on expected revenue.

    best_x_full_capacity:
        It completes the best-x strategy up to full capacity.

    Given a set of products each fixed attention span "x" from

    function chooses the best x based on that lower bound.

    Parameters
    ----------
        products: dict
            Set of products, keys must be the product ids and values
            must be dictionaries with the revenue and probability of

        g: DistributionLike

            Maximum number of items that the retailer can display.
        offset: optional, int, default 0
            An offset to be used when calling the distribution g.

            The best-x and its optimal ranking.
