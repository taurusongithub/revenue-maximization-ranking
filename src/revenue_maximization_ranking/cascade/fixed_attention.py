    An optimal ranking for the fixed attention problem is sorted

    Parameters
    ----------
        product_: tuple[str, dict]
            A tuple describing a product, the first element is its name
            or id, the second element is a dictionary describing its
            revenue if purchased and its probability of being
            purchased.

    -------
        tuple:
            A tuple with the revenue of the product as first element
            and its probability as the second element.

    """Optimal rankings for the fixed attention span problem.

    Given a set of products this function calculates a solution for
    every possible fixed attention span problem with attention ranging
    from 1 up to a defined capacity.

    This implementation is inspired on "Algorithm 1" from
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03800, but returns all of H[0, k]
    elements to avoid the need for the "AssortOpt" algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
        products: dict
            Dictionary with all the products, keys must be the products
            ids and values must be dictionaries with the revenue and
            probability of each product.
        capacity: int
            Maximum capacity of items to be displayed by the retailer.

    Returns
    -------
    rankings, revenues: Tuple[dict, dict]
        Optimal rankings and its corresponding revenues. Each possible
        attention span is the key on those dictionaries.
